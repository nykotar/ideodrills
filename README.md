# Ideodrills

Ideodrills is a website designed for ideogram training. While there are several websites available for this purpose, they often have limitations such as pre-recorded audios, which restrict the variety of ideograms and do not allow for personalized training. Additionally, finding all the necessary ideograms on a single platform can be challenging.

Ideodrills addresses these issues by utilizing the Web Speech API to synthesize text to speech. This allows you to train with any ideogram you choose, and also also train in your preferred language.

## Notice for Mobile Devices

Please note that on mobile devices, the Web Speech API uses the system language for speech synthesis, which may limit the availability of other languages. In addition, some devices may not be compatible.

## Development Environment

You need to have node.js (+16) and npm installed.

### How to run
1. Clone the repository and access it through the terminal
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start` to start the dev server
